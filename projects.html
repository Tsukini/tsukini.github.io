					<h2>FUMIKO</h2>
					<h4>About</h4>
					<p>Fumiko was originally a project for our course of <em>Computer Science</em> on University. In the beginning, it was to finish there but, as we made it, we it saw that was a good project (for that moment was) and we wanted to study about game devolopment and stuffs so, we decided to continue it.</p>
					<p>The game suffered a lot of changes. The first idea was to be a platformer game, the scenario was to be our University and the objective was to defeat our professors. As we had a tiny time to do it and we had to search and study about the engine, we decided to change it to this.</p>
					<p>There is no history on the game, you just have to go down, collect the coins and kill the ants! (Why ants? I have no idea! haha)</p>
					<p><strong>The project project is available on <a href="https://github.com/Tsukini/Fumiko"><i class="fi-social-github"></i> GitHub</a>. We appreciate any help.</strong></p>
